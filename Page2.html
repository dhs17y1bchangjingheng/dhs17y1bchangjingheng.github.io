    <h1>My Learning Journey to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</h1>
    <p>I went on a learning journey to <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/">Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</a>. There, we attended a workshop on categorising living things. We leanrt about the the different levels of categorising, and also practiced categorising some animals.</p>
    <p>In the museum, there were hundreds of thousands of specimens, ranging from insects to amphibians to birds. The famous <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/nus/index.php/collections/sgwhale">'Singapore Whale'</a> was also displayed here.
