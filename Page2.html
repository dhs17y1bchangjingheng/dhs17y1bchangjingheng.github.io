    <h1>My Learning Journey to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</h1>
    <p>I went on a learning journey to <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/">Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</a>. There, we attended a workshop on categorising living things. We also learnt more about the different species of animals.</p>
    <p>In the museum, there were hundreds of thousands of specimens, ranging from insects to amphibians to birds. The famous <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/nus/index.php/collections/sgwhale">'Singapore Whale'</a> was also displayed here. I was awed by the vast collection of specimens in the museum, and it is very interesting to see so many different species of living things. It shows the diversity of living things, and the onces at the museum are only from Southest Asia!</p>
    <p>The guide was very knowledgable and she shared countless of facts and information with us. She showed us the different species of animals and described them in great detail.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, we went to the lab to practice categorising the different living things into their phylums. It was rather challenging as we had to identify the characteristics of them and decide on their phylums. However, we had fun and enjoyed the activity.</p>
    <p>It was a memorable and interesting experience there at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, and I hope to visit it again soon with my family.</p>
